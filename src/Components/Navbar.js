    Hi, I am Full-stack Engineer with a background in Actuarial Science and Sales. After my job contract as a Sales Manager ended, I went on a career hunt. I had been curious about online careers, so I started there. I discovered web development while trying out affiliate marketing. The owner of the course said I needed money to make money and suggested a few online jobs I could do on the side while I worked as an affiliate marketer. One job he recommended was web development. After taking a few courses in Javascript and React, I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It has been 2years+ since my journey began. I work as a Technical Support Engineer at Microverse. In my free time, I continue to build my skills as a developer and write articles on what I think have debugged that the internet hasnâ€™t... yet.
